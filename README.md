Project Overview
The Meal Suggester App is a simple yet user-friendly mobile application developed using React Native with Expo. It is designed to suggest suitable meals based on the time of day the user inputs. From breakfast to late-night dessert, the app offers visual and textual recommendations tailored to the user's routine.

The main goal of this app is to:

Help users plan meals based on specific times of the day.

Encourage healthy eating habits by offering diverse meal options.

Provide an intuitive and visually engaging experience.

App Features
* Input-Based Meal Suggestion
Users input a time of day (e.g. morning, dinner), and the app suggests a meal based on that entry.

* Meal Visuals
Each suggestion includes a corresponding image to create an engaging user experience.

* Reset Functionality
A dedicated reset button clears the current input and any meal suggestion previously made.

* Validation & Alerts
If a user inputs an unrecognized time of day, the app provides an alert explaining the valid inputs.


The final product is:

Fully functional and responsive on mobile.

Tested with multiple time inputs.

Error-free and includes all visual assets.

Ready for deployment via Expo or Play Store.
